# Traffic Sign Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks and Tensorflow
Mar 2021 â€“ Apr 2021

I developed an Artificial Intelligence software that can detect and classify Traffic Signs using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method. I used OpenCV Image Processing and Tensorflow Artificial Intelligence tools in Python programming language. I trained my model with Traffic signs dataset with 99% accuracy. My Artificial Intelligence model can predict and classify multiple traffic signs with high accuracy by scanning the camera image given to it.
